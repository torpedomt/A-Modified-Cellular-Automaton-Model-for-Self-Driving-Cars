# A-Modified-Cellular-Automaton-Model-for-Self-Driving-Cars
## Introduction

This is a solution for 2017 COMAP MCM Problem C.
https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2017/problems/2017_MCM_Problem_C.pdf

## Background
Self-driving, cooperating cars have been proposed as a solution to increase capacity of highways
without increasing number of lanes or roads. The behavior of these cars interacting with the existing
traffic flow and each other is not well understood at this point. The Governor of the state of Washington has asked for analysis of the effects of allowing self-driving, cooperating cars on the roads listed above in Thurston, Pierce, King, and Snohomish counties.  

In the competition, we are given a map of Thurston, Pierce, King, and Snohomish counties and an excel sheet of traffic conditions of this area. We are asked to figure out how self-driving cars will affect the traffic flux within this area and what proportion of self-driving cars will mitigate the traffic problem most.
